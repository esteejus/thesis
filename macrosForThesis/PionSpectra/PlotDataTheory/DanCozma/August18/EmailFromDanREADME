Hi Justin,

Here they are. L and npEMD info is part of each files name. First row is
pion kinetic energy, 2-3 pi- multiplicity, 4-5 pi0 multiplicity, 6-7 pi+
multiplicity, 8-9 pi-/pi+ ratio, 10-11 pi- + pi+ multiplicity. The file
attached to previous mail contained info from the last two lines of each
file in the archive. I interpolate multiplicities because their are
smoother functions of L and npEMD than ratios or chi-squared.
