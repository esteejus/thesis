Recent astronomical measurements of neutron star mergers have reinvigorated questions about the nature of dense matter in the universe. The densities reached in these stars range from  normal nuclear densities $\rho_o$ to upwards of $9\rho_o$, where $\rho_o = \SI{1.7e14}{\gram\per\centi\metre\squared}$, extremely dense matter, which is primarily composed of neutrons. The symmetry energy describes the difference in binding energy between pure neutron matter and symmetric matter with equal number of neutrons and protons. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is related to the pressure, which supports the star preventing it from collapsing under its own gravitation force. For years, theory and experiment  have combined to progressively constrain the equation of state of symmetric matter, and it was in the last decade that the density dependence of pure neutron matter (the symmetry energy), had been constrained at normal nuclear densities and lower, $\rho < \rho_o$. Still large uncertainties still remain at densities around 2$\rho_o$ which are important to the understanding the properties of neutron stars.

Besides measuring neutrons stars directly, the laboratory provides the only way to study dense nuclear matter at different densities, and to probe different proton-neutron asymmetries. Charged pions are produced from nucleon-nucleon collisions through the short-lived intermediate $\Delta$ resonance, in the early, dense parts of heavy pion collisions. Yet, existing experimental data sensitive to the symmetry energy was lacking, prompting the construction of the \spirit Time Projection Chamber (TPC) which was constructed to measure charged pion spectra ($\pi^\pm$) with a high efficiency produced in neutron-rich heavy-ion collisions. This dissertation encompasses the first pion spectra from the most neutron-rich ($\tin{132}{124}$), and neutron-poor ($\tin{108}{112}$) systems. Also we will compare the results with the most recent transport  simulations. We will highlight some of the successes and hope to motivate a discussion in the theoretical community on how to better reproduce the pion phenomena in neutron-rich heavy-ion collisions, which is important for not only constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy, but also for understanding the $\Delta$ and pion roles in neutron stars.
