\section{The Nuclear Equation of State}

\section{Boltzmann Ulong Uhlenbeck (BUU) Transport Code}
Figure of transport simulation code showing collision progression 

\section{Observables}
Figure showing p-n observable lessens at high energy and from all densities 

\section{The $\pi$ observable}
Figure showing delta resonance 
Figure showing pion's produced at 2po 
Figure showing fermi motion effect

\section{Previous Constraints}
Figure showing GW constraint and other previous constraints 
Can you group all the constraints to one nice plot???
