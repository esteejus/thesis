\begin{abstract}

Recent astronomical measurements of neutron star mergers have reinvigorated questions about the nature of dense matter in the universe. The densities reached in these stars range from normal nuclear densities $\rho_o$ to upwards of $4\rho_o$ or even $9\rho_o$ in some models, where $\rho_o = \SI{1.7e14}{\gram\per\centi\metre\cubed}$; representing extremely dense, neutrons rich matter. The symmetry energy describes the difference in binding energy between pure neutron matter and symmetric matter with equal number of neutrons and protons. It is the density dependence of the symmetry energy that is related to the outward pressure, which supports the star, preventing it from collapsing under its own gravitation force. For years, theory and experiment  have combined to progressively constrain the Equation of State (EoS) of symmetric matter, and it was only in the last decade that the density dependence of pure neutron matter, the symmetry energy, had been constrained at normal nuclear densities and lower, $\rho < \rho_o$. Still large uncertainties, and discrepancies on preliminary constraints, remain at densities around 2$\rho_o$ which are critical importance to the understanding the properties of neutron stars.

Besides measuring neutrons stars directly, the laboratory provides the only way to study dense nuclear matter at different densities and proton-neutron asymmetries. It has been shown that charged pions are produced from nucleon-nucleon collisions through the short-lived intermediate $\Delta$ resonances, in the early, dense parts of Heavy Ion Collisions (HICs). Yet, existing pion experimental data tailored to answering questions about the symmetry energy was lacking and suffers from unknown systematic errors. This prompted the construction of the Samurai Pion-Reconstruction and Ion Tracker Time Projection Chamber (\spirit TPC) which was constructed to measure charged pions produced in neutron-rich HICs with a high efficiency. This Dissertation encompasses the first pion spectra from the most neutron-rich ($\tin{132}{124}$), and neutron-poor ($\tin{108}{112}$) systems measured at \SI{270}{\MeVA} taken at the RIBF facility at RIKEN. The total pion ratio was measured to within 4\% and the pion spectra are measured with a high degree of accuracy, marking the first time pion spectra  -- at energies relevant to the symmetry energy -- have been published.  Also, we will compare the results with the most recent transport models which can simulate pion production. We will highlight some of the successes and hope to motivate a discussion in the theoretical community on how to better reproduce the pion phenomena in neutron-rich HICs, which is important for not only constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy, but also for understanding the $\Delta$ and pion roles in neutron stars.
